# HNG Internship Task 1

## Introduction

This project is developed as part of the HNG Internship. The task focuses on creating a dynamic and interactive web page using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project showcases the use of modern web development techniques to provide a seamless user experience.

## Project Overview

The main features of the project include:

1. **Theme Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark modes.
2. **Real-time Clock**: Displays the current UTC time and date, updated every second.
3. **Header Cards**: Interactive cards that display user information and change appearance on hover.
4. **Smooth Animations**: Sections of the page have smooth transition effects when they come into view.
5. **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure of the web page is built using HTML.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout are handled with CSS, including animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic content to the page.

## Features and Functionality

### Theme Toggle

The theme toggle feature allows users to switch between light and dark modes. This functionality is implemented using JavaScript, which listens for a click event on the theme toggle button. The current theme preference is saved in `localStorage` to persist between sessions.

### Real-time Clock

A real-time clock is displayed at the top of the page, showing the current UTC time and date. This is updated every second using JavaScript's `setInterval` function.

### Header Cards

The header section includes cards that display user information, such as a display name and email. These cards have a hover effect that changes their background color and text color, providing a visually appealing interaction. In dark mode, the hover effect is also applied, ensuring consistency across themes.

### Smooth Animations

Sections of the page have smooth transition effects when they come into view. This is achieved using the Intersection Observer API to detect when a section is in view, and CSS transitions to animate the appearance.

### Responsive Design

The web page is designed to be responsive, ensuring it looks good on all devices. Flexbox is used for layout, and media queries adjust the styling for different screen sizes.

## How to Use

1. Interact with the theme toggle button to switch between light and dark modes.
2. Observe the real-time clock displaying the current UTC time and date.
3. Hover over the header cards to see the interactive effects.
4. Scroll down to view the sections with smooth transition animations.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive web page. It showcases the ability to implement modern web development techniques, such as theme toggling, real-time updates, interactive elements, and responsive design. The project is part of the HNG Internship, highlighting the skills and knowledge gained during the program.
